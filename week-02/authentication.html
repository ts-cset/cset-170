# What is Authentication?

### .eight[The process of verifying that something is what it claims to be.]

class: middle, center

# .fourteen[How do we do that?]

---

# Authentication

For a web application, we make a user submit:

- public identification
- one or more pieces of private information

# Authentication

For a web application, we make a user submit:

- public identification
- one or more pieces of private information

.fourteen[What other pieces of private information could we ask for?]

---
name: guidelines

# Auth Guidelines

.fourteen[Before we learn the guidelines, let's see how other apps handle it:]

1. Open a new incognito window in your browser.
2. Go to your example application's registration page.
3. What info do they ask for to authenticate you?
4. Without submitting the form, type in some fake data to see what rules they use to validate the info.

---

# Auth Guidelines

- Email? Phone Number?
- Pick your own username?
- Password? If so, any rules for it?

.fourteen[Which of our example apps are the most secure? Least?]

---

# Auth Guidelines

[OWASP: Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)

User IDs must be:

- unique
- case insensitive
- for uber security, assign them and keep them secret

Email as ID? [Make sure it's a valid email address!](https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html#Email_Address_Validation)

---

# Auth Guidelines

Passwords should:

- have a minimum length of at least 8 characters.
- have a maximum length.
- allow **all** unicode characters.

Bonus Features:

- Use a strength meter so users know a good password.
- Use a service to block common or breached passwords.
- Enforce credential rotation after a breach.

# Auth Guidelines

.fourteen[What's wrong with the following error messages?]

- Login Error: Incorrect password.
- Registration Error: That username is already taken.
- Forgot Password: We emailed you a password reset link.

# Auth Guidelines

.fourteen[What's wrong with the following error messages?]

- Login Error: Incorrect password.
- Registration Error: That username is already taken.
- Forgot Password: We emailed you a password reset link.

.eight[Error messages should be as generic as possible.]

# Auth Guidelines

Other guidelines:

- [Store passwords securely in database](https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- [Implement secure password recovery feature](https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/cheatsheets/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- Use safe functions to compare passwords
- **Only transmit passwords over TLS!**

# Multi-Factor Auth

.eight[Authentication using two or more pieces of evidence.]

Factors:

- **Knowledge**: something the user and only the user knows
- **Possession**: something the user and only the user has
- **Inherence**: something the user and only the user is
- **Location**: somewhere the user and only the user is

[OWASP: Multi-Factor Cheatsheet](https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/cheatsheets/Multifactor_Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)

---

# Multi-Factor Auth

Examples:

- Basic web app asking for password (knowledge): .eleven[X]
- ATMs require a debit card (possession) and a PIN (knowledge): .fourteen[√]
- Bank app asking for password (knowledge) and PIN (knowledge): .eleven[X]
- Laptop asking for password (knowledge) and fingerprint (inherence): .fourteen[√] 
- Web app asking for password (knowledge) and one-time code sent to your phone (possession): .fourteen[√]

# .fourteen[Verification successful. Now what?]

---

# HTTP Is Stateless

- Request &rarr; Response. The end.
- A single request can send authentication info.
- The next request is entirely separate.
- If the next request requires authentication, it needs to be sent again.

Option 1: Make the user fill out a login form every time they make a request.

---
class: middle, center

# .eleven[Option 1 is bad.]

---
name: cookies

# Cookie Based Sessions

.eight[Piece of data stored on the client and sent back with every request.]

- Make HTTP stateful!
- Used for managing auth sessions, user preferences, or tracking users.
- More modern APIs are [Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) and [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
- Session data is sent via Headers:
  - response: .eight[Set-Cookie]
  - request: .eight[Cookie]

[MDN: Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

---

# Cookie Based Sessions

1. User submits login form which sends .eight[POST] request to server.
2. Server authenticates the user and sends a response with session info in the .eight[Set-Cookie] header.
3. Client stores the cookie and will send it for all future requests in the .eight[Cookie] header.
4. Server looks for cookie in request and authenticates it instead of the form.
5. When user logs out, the client deletes the cookie so requests won't be authenticated.

# Cookie Based Sessions

.fourteen[Pros]:
- Sent automatically every request
- Well known, so browsers can handle them well
- Pretty simple

.eleven[Cons]:
- Sent automatically every request
- Require storing session info on server
- Aren't secure

---
name: tokens

# Token Based Sessions

.eight[Piece of data stored on the client and sent back with every request.]

- Seems like cookies, but there's a subtle difference
- Make HTTP stateless again!
- Session data sent via .eight[Authorization] headers
- Token can store much more than session id

Many implementations, like [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and [OpenID](https://openid.net/)

---

# Token Based Sessions

1. User submits login form which sends .eight[POST] request to server.
2. Server authenticates the user and sends a response with a signed token.
3. Client stores the token in local storage and has to send it for all future requests in the .eight[Authorization] header, or in .eight[POST] data.
4. Server decodes the token and uses info to process the request.
5. When user logs out, the client deletes the token.

class: middle, center

![Flowchart of token based session](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*JwpefmqYt1f9eUhd.)

---

# .fourteen[So What's The Difference?]

- Tokens allow the server to be stateless.
- Tokens allow authentication AND authorization info.
- Tokens can be cryptographically secured.
- Tokens can be used outside of traditional web browsers.

# Summary

1. What is Authentication?
2. Auth Guidelines
3. Multi-Factor Auth
4. Session Management
5. Cookies vs Tokens

Tomorrow, we'll talk about .eight[Authorization]!

---

# .fourteen[Practice]

1. Run your flaskr application and open it in the browser.
2. Open your dev tools to the Network tab, check "Preserve Log".
3. Submit the login form. Can you see the form data in the request?
4. What headers are sent with the response?

---

# .fourteen[Practice]

1. Is Flask using Cookie or Token based sessions?
2. Open the Application tab. Can you find where the session data is stored?
3. Make a new request. Do you see the session in the headers?
4. Log out. What happened to the session data?
