    Lab 03: Fixing Vulnerabilities
  </h1>

  <hr>

  <p>
    You're going to install and run a pre-built web application and see how secure it is. The name of the lab should be a clue: <em>it's not</em>. And you're going to fix it.  
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>
    Setup
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Install, configure, and run MongoDB
      <pre><code>
$ brew install mongodb
$ sudo makedir -p /data/db
$ sudo chown -R $USER /data/db
$ mongod
      </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat" target="_blank">the NodeGoat project</a></li>
    <li>Clone your forked repo</li>
    <li>Configure the project to use your local instance of MongoDB
      <pre><code>
# Open config/env/development.js in your editor and uncomment
# line 8 which points the db connection to your localhost.
# Then run:

$ npm install
$ node node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt db-reset:development
$ npm run db:seed
      </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Start the server
      <pre><code>
$ npm start
      </code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You should now be able to see the app running on your machine at <a href="http://localhost:4000" target="_blank">http://localhost:4000</a>
  </p>

  <h2>
    Fix It!
  </h2>

  <p>
    When you seeded the database, it contained a few user accounts. You can find their usernames and passwords in the project's README. Log in to the app and look around for a bit to get an idea of what it does.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    Follow <a href="http://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/tutorial">the tutorial that OWASP provides</a> to fix the problems you learned about in their Top Ten list. Watch the videos they provide of the vulnerabilities and try them on your local version. Try to break it!
  </p>

  <h2>
    Grading
  </h2>

  <p>
    Make a new new branch in your repo that will contain all of your fixes. You should be committing frequently since this is a fragile app and you're actively trying to break it. When you're done, push the branch to GitHub and submit a PR to your fork, <strong>not the real repo</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Submit a link to your PR on the portal for this assignment.
