# Overview

How does security fit into software development?

- Foundational security concepts
- Authentication and authorization
- Awareness of common security issues
- Techniques to mitigate these issues

---

# Disclaimer

*This course is mainly theory.*

We'll discuss guiding principles and best practices, but every situation is unique and every company/team/project handles it differently according to real-world constraints.

.eight[Security is the practice of identifying what could go wrong and trying to mitigate the impact for when it does.]

# It is effectively impossible to assure that a piece of software is secure.

---

# Impossibly Secure

- It doesn't run in a vaccuum. There are outside factors.
- Security often conflicts with usability and business goals.
- Humans write software, and humans make mistakes.

Given enough time, any system may eventually be compromised.

---

# Outcomes, not Assurances

Assurance is not affordable.

- You **can't** guarantee prevention.
- You **can** mitigate the outcome.

---

# Outcomes Are Different

Imagine two blog sites, built with the same technology:

- One is a forum for video game walkthroughs.
- One is a forum for political activism.

Each site has different security goals.

name: objectives

# Security Objectives

- The goals that define the behaviors of a system.
- Help decide priority and guide development.
- Created in requirements gathering and planning phase of software development cycle.

---

# Security Objectives

The format:

When .eight[[an actor]] attempts .eight[[a bad action]], the system will .eight[[respond with reaction]].

- **Actor**: a type of user
- **Action**: something that shouldn't happen, intentional or not
- **Response**: prevention, monitoring, or something more

# Threat Modeling

.eight[Formal process to identify and categorize threats to a system.]

1. List all the **Actors** that interact with the system.
2. List all the **Assets** of the system.
3. Create model for interaction of each **Actor** with each **Asset**.

*So a system with 3 types of actors and 4 types of assets has 12 interactions, multiplied by the 4 CRUD operations, which is a total of **48 threat vectors**.*

# Threat Model

Imagine all the possible interactions:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th class="center middle" colspan="2">Authors</th>
    <th class="center middle" colspan="2">Anonymous</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="center middle" rowspan="2">Articles</th>
    <td class="center middle">C</td>
    <td class="center middle">R</td>
    <td class="center middle">C</td>
    <td class="center middle">R</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center middle">U</td>
    <td class="center middle">D</td>
    <td class="center middle">U</td>
    <td class="center middle">D</td>
  </tr>
</table>

How should each actor be able to interact with each asset?

# Security Objectives

When .eight[[an actor]] attempts .eight[[a bad action]], the system will .eight[[respond with reaction]].

Using this threat model, we can write security objectives for our system:

- When an author attempts to update/delete someone else's article, the system will respond by preventing the action.
- When an anonymous user attempts to create/update/delete an article, the system will respond by preventing and logging the action.

---

# Using Objectives

- Defined in planning process to help development
- Can be used to create tests for TDD
- Can be used to create documentation

---

# Summary

- Security is managing the outcomes of possible interactions within a system so that it meets **well-defined** objectives.
- Paying attention to outcomes will have more impact than only looking at prevention.

The breaches we looked at earlier could've been mitigated with better security objectives and an expectation that they would be compromised.
