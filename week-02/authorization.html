# What is Authorization?

Authentication is the process of verifying that something is what it claims to be.

.eight[Authorization is the process of verifying that someone can can do what they are trying to do.]

# What is Authorization?

- Rules for the code that define what .eight[functionality and data] the user may access.
- Access controls allow users of different .eight[privileges] to use the same application.
- This requires .eight[administrators] to manage the rules and grant priveleges.

# Access Control Policies

Different methods for different uses:

- Role Based Access Control
- Discretionary Access Control
- Mandatory Access Control
- Permission Based Access Control

A single app can mix and match these strategies according to it's threat model.

name: exercise

# .fourteen[Group Learning]

Break into groups, one for each policy, and answer the following questions:

1. How does your access control policy work?
2. Generally, how secure is it?
3. What are pros and cons?
4. What real-world examples use this policy that can help us understand it?

At the end of class, your group will present your policy.

---

# .fourteen[Further Discussion]

Once we've learned about all the access control policies:

- Which does the flaskr app use?
- Which does your example app use?
- What about the school portal?
- Which seems easiest to implement on our own in Python?
- Are there libraries that can handle this for us?
