# Measuring Risk

When you're comparing vulnerabilities, how do you know which is more dangerous?

Think of risk assessment for:

- Insurance
- Crime
- Disease
- Wild Animals

---

# Measuring Risk

- **Exploitability**: How _easy_ is it to attack?
- **Prevalence**: How _frequent_ is it found?
- **Detectability**: How _noticeable_ is it?
- **Impact**: How _significant_ is the damage?

If a vulnerability scores high for each measure, then you should prioritize it as an important and urgent fix.

Threat Levels: .eleven[Critical] | .thirteen[Serious] | Medium

# OWASP Top Ten

[Open Web Application Security Project:](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

<blockquote>"The OWASP Top Ten is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications."</blockquote>

Here's the list...

# Injection

Occurs when untrusted data is interpreted as code.

.eleven[Exploitable] | .thirteen[Prevalent] | .thirteen[Detectable] | .eleven[Impact]

- Any data provided by a user is "untrusted"
- If the interpreter runs the data as code, then the attacker can run any code they want
- **Sanitize all user input, escape data when you display it**

[OWASP: Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)

---
name: auth

# Broken Authentication

Occurs when an attacker can impersonate other users.

.thirteen[Exploitable] | .eleven[Prevalent] | .thirteen[Detectable] | .eleven[Impact]

- Flaws in authentication or session management
- Attacker can compromise passwords, keys, or tokens
- **Don't rely on custom implementation, use trusted solutions**

[OWASP: Broken Authentication](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication.html)

---
name: xss

# Cross-Site Scripting

Occurs when untrusted data is interpreted by browser as code.

.thirteen[Exploitable] | .eleven[Prevalent] | .eleven[Detectable] | .thirteen[Impact]

- Like injection, interpreting unsafe data as code
- Unlike injection, code is run locally by user's browser
- **Sanitize and escape data, use proper encodings and headers**

[OWASP: XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)

---
name: dor

# Direct Obeject Reference

Occurs when application exposes info about how it works.

.eleven[Exploitable] | .thirteen[Prevalent] | .eleven[Detectable] | .thirteen[Impact]

- Developer might reveal file or directory names, usernames or IDs, database tables, etc.
- Attacker can modify requests to other objects
- **Use indirect references and always check access**

[OWASP: ](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

---
name: mcfg

# Security Misconfiguration

Occurs when attacker gains access because of bad/missing settings.

.eleven[Exploitable] | .thirteen[Prevalent] | .eleven[Detectable] | .thirteen[Impact]

- A common example is not changing default usernames and passwords
- Can occur accross all levels of the tech stack: libraries to operating systems
- **Use current, patched versions and follow the documentation**

[OWASP: Security Misconfig](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration.html)

---
name: data

# Sensitive Data Exposure

Occurs when attackers can view sensitive data

Exploitable | .thirteen[Prevalent] | .eleven[Detectable] | .eleven[Impact]

- Examples are financial data, tax information, health records, credentials
- Data can be captured at rest or in transit
- **Only store what you need and use heavy encryption**

[OWASP: Data Exposure](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure.html)

---
name: acss

# Bad Access Controls

Occurs when an application doesn't make appropriate access checks.

.eleven[Exploitable] | .thirteen[Prevalent] | .thirteen[Detectable] | .thirteen[Impact]

- Even if a UI blocks access, an attacker can forge requests to the server
- Authentication is not enough
- **Preform access checks across all levels of the stack**

[OWASP: Bad Access Controls](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control.html)

---
name: csrf

# Cross-Site Request Forgery

Occurs when an attacker forces a victim to send an unintended request.

.thirteen[Exploitable] | .thirteen[Prevalent] | .eleven[Detectable] | .thirteen[Impact]

- The attacker gets an authenticated and authorized user to do what they want
- Victim's browser sends a valid request, so the application allows it
- **Generate tokens for each response-request pair**

[OWASP: CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)

---
name: comp

# Insecure Components

Occurs when third-party tools have vulnerabilities.

.thirteen[Exploitable] | .eleven[Prevalent] | Detectable | .thirteen[Impact]

- Applications rely on third-party code and run it with full privileges
- Attackers might see vulnerabilities before you do and exploit them
- **Only use what you have to and continuously audit them**

[OWASP: Insecure Components](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities.html)

---
name: redr

# Redirects

Occurs when applications send users to untrusted destinations.

.eleven[Exploitable] | .thirteen[Prevalent] | .thirteen[Detectable] | .eleven[Impact]

- Attackers can modify input so that users are sent to malicious sites
- The user continues to trust the new destination
- **Don't use redirects, but if you must, don't trust user input to get there**

# .fourteen[Fix A Vulnerable App]

Introducing the NodeGoat Project:

- **RetireEasy** Employee Retirement Savings Management
- Basic CRUD application with authentication and RBAC
- Built with Node, Express, and MongoDB

.eleven[It suffers from all of the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities!]

---

# .fourteen[Fix A Vulnerable App]

1. Get the app set up and running.
2. Follow the tutorial to learn about each vulnerability.
3. Use the feature as a regular user, then as an attacker.
4. Then follow the steps to fix the problem, if possible.
5. Try to attack the feature again. Were you stopped?
